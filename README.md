This algorithm takes an image as input and detects if the article shown on it is placed over a uniform white background. Overall, the algorithm is conformed by 3 stages. The first stage counts how many pixels are white, if this number is greater or equal to threshold_1 then the image will be processed by the following stage. The second stage is a special function that computes the proportion of pixels in the border of the image that belong to the background, if this proportion is greater or equal to threashod_2 then the image will pass to the last stage. In the last stage, the image is processed by Restnet18. If, in this stage, the image is classified as 1, then it contains an appropriate background and an inappropriate background otherwise.
