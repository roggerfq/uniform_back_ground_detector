# Uniform white background detector
## Description
This algorithm aims to detect whether a product image has a uniform white background. This requirement is crucial in e-commerce platforms for maintaining a consistent and professional appearance, as well as to help minimize distractions, allowing customers to focus solely on showcased products. The following figure depicts the stages of the algorithm:

Conceptually, the algorithm is comprised of four stages. In the first stage, it computes the percentage of white pixels. If this percentage is greater than or equal to **threshold_pixels_1**, then the image will be processed by the following stage. The second stage computes the percentage of white pixels at the edges of the image. If this percentage is greater than or equal to **threshold_pixels_2**, then the image will be processed by the following stage. The third stage identifies all the pixels that meet the following criteria: (1) the pixel is white, and (2) there exists a path from the pixel to any pixel on the edge of the image composed solely of white pixels. If the percentage of pixels that meet these criteria is greater than or equal to **threshold_pixels_3**, then the image will be processed by the following stage. In the final stage, a ResNet model, trained with masks generated by the third stage (binary mask), classifies whether the image contains a uniform white background.

## Test model
To test the pretrained model, execute the following line. It will evaluate the pretrained model using a set of images:
``` shell
Python test.py
```
You can also test the next link on Google Colab, where you can evaluate the model with a random image: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aAmBuJyjuvnDr1mOLHa8BIlzvzBFmXU0?usp=sharing)
